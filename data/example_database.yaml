# This YAML file builds a database of ORP objects. These objects are the
# "canonical" definition of objects that ORP can recognize. Some of the
# attributes, such as mass, may not be fully utilized.
# the color, nickname, geometry, and size determine how the object will look
# when visualized as an RViz marker.
#
# Additional commented-out objects are at the end of this file for reference.
#
# Dimensions are in mm.
# Color values range from 0 to 1.
# The acceptable values for "geometry" are BLOB (sphere), CYLINDER, and BOX.
